### Abstract

Evidence-based program registries (EBPRs) are essential tools in prevention science, providing structured evaluations of intervention effectiveness to guide policymakers and practitioners. While established registries such as Blueprints for Healthy Youth Development and Xchange have been instrumental in cataloging evidence-based programs, Latin America has lacked a region-specific repository tailored to its unique prevention challenges. Evidencia Viva was developed to address this gap by systematically assessing and classifying substance use prevention programs implemented and evaluated in Latin America. The initiative draws from established EBPR models, employing rigorous inclusion criteria and a multidisciplinary expert review process to evaluate intervention efficacy. Programs are categorized into five tiers, ranging from beneficial to potentially harmful, ensuring that decision-makers have access to transparent and reliable information. The registry’s initial assessments include interventions from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay, highlighting both effective and ineffective programs. Notably, programs like Unplugged and Keepin’ It REAL have demonstrated positive impacts, while others, such as PROERD (the Brazilian adaptation of DARE) and #Tamojunto, have shown limited or even negative effects. Despite its potential to strengthen evidence-based prevention in the region, Evidencia Viva faces challenges, including the limited number of rigorously evaluated programs, disparities in research capacity across Latin American countries, and the need for sustained funding to ensure long-term viability. Evidencia Viva contributes to the accessibility and dissemination of validated interventions, supporting informed policymaking and more effective substance use prevention strategies. However, ensuring its sustainability will require continued investment in research capacity, funding, and regional collaboration.
